## A little bit about me

💻 &nbsp;I'm a front-end developer with a passion for crafting clean, responsive, and engaging web experiences using **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**.  
🎨 &nbsp;I enjoy working with **CSS**, **Styled-Components**, and **Unocss** to bring designs to life.  
🔧 &nbsp;For state management, I'm experienced with **MobX** and **Redux**.  
🚀 &nbsp;When it comes to deployment, I’ve used **Vercel** and **Docker** to ship projects efficiently.  
🌍 &nbsp;Currently working remotely, I’m always excited about building things that are meaningful and scalable.  
🗣️ &nbsp;I'm open to new opportunities and collaboration — feel free to reach out!  
✉️ &nbsp;Drop me an email and let's talk tech, product, or anything in between.
